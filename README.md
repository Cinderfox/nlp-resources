# NLP Resources

This repository contains a series of Natural Language Processing (NLP) codes. Each code focuses on a different aspect of NLP, from basic analysis to more advanced techniques. Each code includes some comments to help understand its functionality and purpose.

## Contents

- **1 - Simple Analysis of Sentences**: Basic sentence analysis techniques.
- **2 - Porter Stemmer**: Implementation and application of the Porter Stemmer algorithm.
- **3 - Cosine Similarity**: Measuring similarity between text documents using cosine similarity.
- **4 - Viterbi Algorithm**: Implementing the Viterbi algorithm for sequence prediction.
- **5 - N-Gram Model**: Building and using N-gram models for text processing.
- **6 - Minimum Edit Distance**: Calculating the minimum edit distance between strings.
- **7 - Parsing**: Techniques and algorithms for syntactic parsing of sentences.
- **8 - Chart Parser**: Implementing a chart parser for context-free grammars.
- **9 - Lesk Algorithm on WSD**: Applying the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation.
- **10 - Name Entity Recognition**: Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **11 - Text Summarization**: Techniques for summarizing text content.
